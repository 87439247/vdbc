Fork for dialect enhancements, jetty integration and dependency upgrades.

It's planned to provide support for:

- other servlet containers (as fas as changes make sense)
- custom containers providing the full vaadin infrastructure (reduced war dependencies)
- custom containers providing new log4j-2 support with slf4-binding (there seems to be a collision)
- updated vaadin dependencies
- maybe a little tool to build a vdbc-deployment for custom environments.
- maybe an interface for dynamic extraction of the application components to integrate vdbc in a custom Vaadin UI application.
